# Solar-Flare-Classification-Model

The decision to map rather than one-hot-encode the categorical classification features of the sunspots was done as there is a ranking as to how each letter represents the intensity of the sunspot as well as other charecteristics. One hot encoding would also massively increase the number of feature columns which would be inefficient for modelling and may not truly capture what the classifications mean.
